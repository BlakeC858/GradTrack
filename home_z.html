      <p>She was born on November 15th, 1887 in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. She died at the age of 98 on March 6th, 1986.</p>
      <p>O’Keeffe was raised on a dairy farm in Wisconsin where she was taught about art at an early age. She was focused at a young age to become a  professional painter with her styles of imitative realism, but lost confidence in the dream as the styles of imitative realism weren't favorable. She became a teacher for most  of her life, where she shared the knowledge of art to others.  She later would go to Chicago to learn about and apply Asian culture in her art and soon emerged as a modernist when she traveled to South Carolina.</p>

            <p>Georgia O’Keeffe is known for her paintings of flowers, bones, and the built landscape unique to New York City and New Mexico. Her artwork followed Asian art styles as she kept her artwork clean and simple. Her paintings of flowers showed how the zoomed-in photographs of flowers were popular at the time. She would paint ovals  and spirals.
